A dynamic resume site using [Bulma CSS](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) written in Go.
Get up and running easily by defining the content in a single YAML file.

Shamelessly copied from [mazipan's](https://github.com/mazipan) [bulma-resume-template](https://github.com/mazipan/bulma-resume-template).
